# 🚚 Cloud-Native Multi-Agent Logistics Control Tower (V3.2)

A state-of-the-art, cloud-native logistics management system powered by **Gemini 2.0 Flash** and **LangChain**. This system orchestrates multiple AI agents to provide data-driven insights, operational strategy, and automated communication.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system follows a modern, decoupled architecture designed for scalability and intelligence:

- **Frontend**: Streamlit-based interactive dashboard with Voice-to-Text capabilities, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and a Data Explorer.
- **Backend**: FastAPI services deployed on **Google Cloud Run**, acting as the brain for AI orchestration.
- **AI Brain**: **LangChain** multi-agent framework utilizing **Gemini 2.0 Flash** (Experimental) via Google Vertex AI.
- **Data Layer**: **Google BigQuery** serving as the centralized data warehouse for shipment, fleet, and driver data.
- **Security**: Granular RBAC implemented at the AI context layer to ensure data privacy.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. 🤖 Collaborative Multi-Agent Workflow
- **Logistics Analyst**: Directly queries BigQuery using natural language to extract specific data points.
- **Fleet Strategist**: Takes data results and applies business logic to suggest optimizations.
- **Communication Assistant**: Handles outgoing notifications and simulated email workflows.

### 2. 🎤 Multimodal Interaction
- **Voice-to-Query**: Integrated microphone support allows users to speak their requests (e.g., "Show me delayed shipments").
- **Smart Transcription**: Automated conversion of audio to text for seamless AI processing.

### 3. 🛡️ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Logistics Manager**: Full access to financial and operational data.
- **Fleet Operator**: Access to operational status; restricted from seeing costs and profits.
- **Guest**: Highly restricted access to basic public shipment status only.

### 4. 📊 Static & Live Data Explorer
- Instantly view sample data schemas to understand the available logistics information without hitting the database repeatedly.

### 5. 📧 Integrated Communication Hub
- Centralized UI for checking alerts and sending simulated notifications to dispatchers and drivers.

### 6. 🧠 Conversational Memory & Follow-ups
- **Short-Term Memory**: Remembers the last 5 interactions to maintain context.
- **Smart Follow-ups**: AI suggests logical next steps or questions based on the current analysis.

#### 🧪 Memory Demonstration Scenarios
| Scenario | Initial Question | Memory Follow-up (Context Aware) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operational** | "List all shipments that are currently 'Delayed'." | "What is the **total revenue** for these shipments?" |
| **Fleet Ops** | "Show me all 'Heavy Trucks' in the fleet." | "Are any of **them** over 100,000 km in mileage?" |
| **Strategy** | "Identify shipments with a cost higher than $1,500." | "What are the **cargo types** for these specific orders?" |

## 🛠️ Multi-Agent Workflow Detail

When a user asks: *"Why is the London shipment delayed and who should I notify?"*

1.  **Orchestrator** receives the query and identifies it needs **Data** and **Action**.
2.  **Logistics Analyst** generates a BigQuery SQL query to find shipment #123 (London) and retrieves the status and driver details.
3.  **Fleet Strategist** analyzes the delay reason (e.g., weather) and suggests a reroute or alert.
4.  **Communication Assistant** prepares a simulated email draft for the dispatcher.
5.  **Orchestrator** synthesizes all these into a single, cohesive response for the user.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Environment Variables**:
    - `API_URL`: URL of the deployed FastAPI backend.
    - `DATABASE_URL`: BigQuery connection string.
3.  **Model Garden**: Ensure Gemini 2.0 Flash is enabled in Vertex AI Model Garden.

## ☁️ Deployment Guide (Google Cloud)

### 1. Prerequisites
- Install [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
- Enable required APIs:
  ```bash
  gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com \
                         aiplatform.googleapis.com \
                         bigquery.googleapis.com \
                         artifactregistry.googleapis.com
  ```

### 2. Deploy Backend
Navigate to the root and run:
```bash
gcloud run deploy logistics-agent-backend \
    --source ./backend \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --allow-unauthenticated \
    --set-env-vars "DATABASE_URL=bigquery://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]/logistics_control_tower" \
    --memory=1Gi
```
*Note the Service URL returned after deployment.*

### 3. Deploy Frontend
Run from the root directory:
```bash
gcloud run deploy logistics-frontend \
    --source . \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --allow-unauthenticated \
    --set-env-vars "API_URL=[YOUR_BACKEND_URL]"
```

### 4. Setup BigQuery
Ensure a dataset named `logistics_control_tower` exists in your project with the required tables (`shipments`, `vehicles`, `drivers`).

## 💡 Queries to Try (Advanced Logistics Intelligence)
Explore the power of the multi-agent system with these specific queries:
